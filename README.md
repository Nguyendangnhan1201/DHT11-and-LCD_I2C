Project name: DHT11-and-LCD_I2C
Overview: This is an arduino project in which DHT11 sensor is combined with LCD 1602 module. The project aims to display temperature and humidity values onto the LCD screen as well as setting the alarm for specific temperature ranges.
Materials: 1 Arduino board( I used Arduino UNO R3), 1 LCD 1602 and an I2C, 1 DHT11 sensor, 1 buzzer, wires.
Libraries to be downloaded for the project: DHT.h; Wire.h; LiquidCrystal_I2C.h
